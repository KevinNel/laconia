            <p class="lead">An MVC PHP Application without libraries or frameworks.</p>

            <p>Laconia is a personal project created by <a href="https://www.taniarascia.com">Tania Rascia</a> to learn the fundamentals of programming and modern web development from scratch. The main goals of the project are to learn MVC (Model View Controller) architecture, the OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) paradigm, routing, modern development practices, and how to tie it all together to make a functional web app.</p>

            <p>Laconia runs on PHP 7.2 and MySQL. It uses <a href="https://getcomposer.org/">Composer</a> to autoload classes and configuration and utility files, as well as future tests through <a href="https://phpunit.de/">PHPUnit</a>. Node is used to compile Sass to CSS via npm scripts.</p>

            <p>Please feel free to fork, use, comment, critique, suggest, improve or help in any way.</p>
